Greatness
It's just something we made up
Somehow we've come to believe that greatness is a gift
Reserved for a chosen few
For prodigies
For superstars
And the rest of us can only stand by watching
You can forget that
Greatness is not some rare DNA strand
It's not some precious thing
Greatness is not more unique to us than breathing
We're all capable of it
All of us

Some people are told they were born with greatness
Some people tell themselves

If greatness doesn't come knocking at your door
Maybe you should go knock on its door

Sometimes greatness is about overcoming insurmountable adversity
Sometimes is just fun

Greatness isn't always measured in tenths of a point
It's a bit bigger than that

Sometimes greatness is something you plan
But most of the time is just something you try

Is easy to think greatness is something you see on TV
Unless of course, greatness is watching TV

Greatness is a scary thing
Until it isn't

If we think greatness is supposed to look a certain way, act a certain way and play a certain way
We certainly need to rethink some things

Is it speed or endurance?
Does it happen in two hours or for or six?
Is it finishing strong? Or barely finishing?
Yes

Is greatness worth fighting for?
What do you think?

If we face our fears
It means we're pointed in the right direction
Even if that direction is upside down

It's not the biggest stadium in the world
Not the biggest players either
But the pursuit of greatness is kinda big enough, isn't it?

You don't need an official court
An official net
Or official uniforms
To be officially great

Greatness speaks for itself
Once it learns to talk

Greatness needs a lot of things
But it doesn't need an audience

Some measure greatness in precious metals
Like iron

Greatness is not born
It's made

If you try to tell the guy with the sword he's not great because he's not famous
Be my guest

There are no grand celebrations here
No speeches
No bright lights
But there are great athletes
Somehow we've come to believe that greatness is reserved for the chosen few
For the superstars
The truth is
Greatness is for all of us
This is not about lowering expectations
It's about raising them for every last one of us
Because greatness is not in one special place
And it's not in one special person
Greatness is wherever somebody is trying to find it.
